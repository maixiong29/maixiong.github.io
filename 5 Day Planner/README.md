### Day Planner

A day planner is used to keep one organized on a daily basis.  A person can add important events to this day planner to manage their time effectively.

The day planner allows the user to input their events/tasks into each time slot and has them save that event into LocalStorage.  Once an event/task has passed for the day (9am-5pm, local time), the row will turn gray.  If in the current time, the event/task will be red and if its a futute event/task it will be green.

The current time and day is displayed at the top of the page in local time.
