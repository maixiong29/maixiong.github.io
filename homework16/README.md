This app allows a user to view create and track daily workouts. It allows the user to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. The user can track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise that he/she would like. The fitness tracker will help the user reach their fitness goals faster npw that they can track their progress.


How the app works is when the user loads the page, the user is given the option to create a new workout, or continue with their last workout that they have saved.  The user can also look at their stats on the Stats page to see how they are doing and where they need to improve.
