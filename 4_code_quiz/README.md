### Avengers Quiz Challenge


### Avengers Assemble!

For our introduction to Javascript for this course, we were asked to make a quiz challenge using Javascript.  The goal of this quiz is to answer all of the questions correctly before the time runs out.  If a user answers incorrectly, 10 seconds is deducted from the time remaining.  The faster a user answer questions correctly, the more points the user accumulates.

Test your knowledge of the Avengers!
