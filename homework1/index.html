                   I have two boys that are always keeping me busy.  Their names are Mason (3) and Kyrie (1).  Some things we've done this year includes
                   having gone to San Diego Zoo, Minnesota State Fair, Las Vegas, and the National Sequioa Forest.<br>
                    <br>
                   My husband and I are very competetive when it comes to fishing and board games.  We have a rule that even if you know that you have no chance of winning at Monopoly or Catan,
                   you cannot quit the game or give up until the other person lets you.  I think in the future we might have to come up with a safe word, just to calm everyone down, since there
                   has been times that certain games have become very intense.

                    We always do an annual trip to Devil's Lake, North Dakota for white bass, walleyes, and northerns.  It is always fun and relaxing.  Even though it's 6 hours away, it's totally
                    worth the drive.  We haven't been skunked so far.
