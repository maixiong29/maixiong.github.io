# Team Profile

This HTML team profile generator helps a user create a team profile by inputting in information for each individual on his/her team.  There are different icons and colors for each different positions and they are:

* Manager
* Engineer
* Intern
* Employee

Each position requires additional information as well and these incude:

* Manager:  office number
* Engineer:  GitHub username
* Intern:  school



How the generator works is the User will be prompted with who the manager of the team is first.  Then, the user will be asked what the manager's name, id, and email are (same for the other positions as well).  Once the user is done answering questions about the manager, the user will get the choice of choosing from who to add next to the user's team: engineer, intern and employee.  If the user does not anymore positions to add, the user can select 'No more addiditions', and a 'team.html' will be generated for the user to view.
